This is just a simple youtube downloader and i think if you read the code for first time you get it , if not , this is not your problem , and i think the difficult part is for 'itag' and get data , if you search several times you get it :> . 

### How to use 
First , download the file . 
Second , run the code (If your country is under sanctions , use VPN) .
And done , while you run the code you get what you must do :) .

### Question that you might ask 
-Why this don't have 1080p quality most time .       
+Beacuse the link that we find in the youtube for download is not 1080p with sound and if you want 1080p you must merge video that have no sound with the sound and i don't want to write complicated code that no one get it :>
